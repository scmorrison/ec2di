# About

ec2di is a node.js clone of the ansible [ec2.py](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/plugins/inventory/ec2.py) dynamic inventory script. This script aims to be compatible with the original [ec2.ini](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/plugins/inventory/ec2.ini) file used by ec2.py.
